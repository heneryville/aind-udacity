* Record statistics about each run (win/loss, depth explored, leafs explored)
* Make a compute cluster on AWS Lambda to better evaluate. Goal is to run 10,000 iterations quickly
* Weight score functions jump points by reachable nodes from that square
* Use initiative in score function to penalize squares that could be taken by the opponent
* De-duplication in search using rotation/flipping
* Bitboard for faster compuatation
* Stop being fatalistic in get_move. Don't give up so easily
