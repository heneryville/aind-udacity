X Record statistics about each run (win/loss, depth explored, leafs explored)
X Make a compute cluster on AWS Lambda to better evaluate. Goal is to run 10,000 iterations quickly
X Weight score functions jump points by reachable nodes from that square
X Use initiative in score function to penalize squares that could be taken by the opponent
X De-duplication in search using rotation/flipping
* Bitboard for faster compuatation
* Stop being fatalistic in get_move. Don't give up so easily
